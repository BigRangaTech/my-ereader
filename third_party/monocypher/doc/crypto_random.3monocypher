.Dt CRYPTO_RANDOM 3MONOCYPHER
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto_random ,
.Nm crypto_random_last_error
.Nd fill a buffer with OS-backed random bytes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In monocypher.h
.Ft int
.Fo crypto_random
.Fa "uint8_t *out"
.Fa "size_t out_size"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo crypto_random_last_error
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn crypto_random
fills
.Fa out
with
.Fa out_size
cryptographically secure random bytes.
It is a convenience wrapper around the operating system random number
generator.
.Pp
On Windows,
BCryptGenRandom
is used.
On Unix-like systems, the function prefers
arc4random_buf
or
getrandom ,
and falls back to
.Pa /dev/urandom
if those are unavailable.
.Pp
If
.Fa out_size
is 0,
.Fn crypto_random
returns
.Dv CRYPTO_OK
and does nothing.
.Pp
When compiled with
.Dv MONOCYPHER_RNG_DIAGNOSTICS=1 ,
.Fn crypto_random_last_error
returns the last platform-specific RNG error captured by
.Fn crypto_random .
On Unix-like systems this is
.Dv errno ;
on Windows it is the
.Dv NTSTATUS
value returned by
BCryptGenRandom .
The stored value is reset to 0 on successful
.Fn crypto_random
calls.
The diagnostic value is only meaningful after
.Fn crypto_random
returns
.Dv CRYPTO_ERR_CONFIG .
This diagnostic state is global and not thread-safe.
.Pp
If Monocypher is built with
.Dv MONOCYPHER_STRERROR=1 ,
.Xr crypto_strerror 3monocypher
can be used to convert error codes to strings.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn crypto_random
returns
.Dv CRYPTO_OK
on success.
On error it returns a negative error code:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv CRYPTO_ERR_NULL
.Fa out
is NULL while
.Fa out_size
is non-zero.
.It Dv CRYPTO_ERR_SIZE
On Windows,
.Fa out_size
exceeds
.Dv ULONG_MAX .
.It Dv CRYPTO_ERR_CONFIG
The OS RNG failed or was not accessible.
.El
.Pp
If
.Dv MONOCYPHER_RNG_DIAGNOSTICS=1
is enabled,
.Fn crypto_random_last_error
returns 0 when no error is recorded, or a platform-specific error code
when
.Fn crypto_random
fails.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Prefer
.Fn crypto_random
or the operating system RNG over user-space pseudo-random generators.
If you require a specific entropy source or advanced error handling,
use the OS API directly.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn crypto_random
function first appeared in this fork.
